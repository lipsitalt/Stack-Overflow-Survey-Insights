## Abstract
This repository contains key findings from the analysis of data collected as part of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. The survey provides insights into various aspects of technology usage, trends, and demographics among developers.

## Overview
## Objective: 
The primary objective of the annual surveys is to gather data regarding technology usage and trends among developers.
## Dataset: 
I examined a subset of the 2019 dataset (present dataset: N = 11,398; original dataset N ‚âà 90,000).
## Audience: 
Developers (current and aspiring), HR professionals, educators, and policy makers.
## Data Source

Databases
Platforms
Web frameworks
Technologies Desired for the Next Year

Demographics:

Gender
Country
Age
Education level
Key Findings
Compensation & Demographics
Sample size after compensation outlier removal: N = 10,519 (vs. before removal: N = 11,398)
Respondents‚Äô median age: 29
Gender distribution: 93.5% male, 6.5% female
Median compensation: $52,704 USD per year
Positive correlation between compensation and age (r = 0.40)
Median compensation higher for women ($54,956) than men ($52,339)
Programming Language Trends
Findings:

JavaScript and HTML/CSS were the most popular in 2019 and are likely to remain so.
SQL remains popular.
Increasing interest in Python and TypeScript.
Decreasing interest in PowerShell/Bash.
Implications:
